                    <span class="ds-pr-info">• System</span>
                    <p>A system is a group of individual identities within 1 brain. The amount these identities are separated can vary between systems.</p>
                    <span class="ds-pr-info">• Alter</span>
                    <p>Alter is a term for one individual identity within a system. Other terms include headmate, part, system member. Follow the system's lead on what terms to use for their members.</p>
                    <span class="ds-pr-info">• Fronting</span>
                    <p>Fronting is when a particular alter is the one controlling the body. It's possible for multiple alters to be fronting at once ("cofronting"), or for just one to be.</p>
                    <span class="ds-pr-info">• Switching</span>
                    <p>Switching is when which alter is fronting changes.</p>
                    <p>This can be "possessive switching" where it feels like another alter takes over the body, or "non-possessive switching" where it feels like the alter who was fronting before becomes the other alter.</p>
                    <span class="ds-pr-info">• Headspace</span>
                    <p>Headspace is an internal, non-physical space where different alters in the same system can interact with each other. Headspaces vary a lot between systems, with some having full, detailed worlds, and some having no headspace at all.</p>
                    <span class="ds-pr-info">• Singlet</span>
                    <p>A singlet is anyone who isn't a system/plural.</p>
                    <span class="ds-pr-info">• DID</span>
                    <p>DID stands for Dissociative Identity Disorder. It's a disorder which is characterized in the DSM-5 by disruption of identity (having multiple alters/switching) and dissociative amnesia, which cause distress or impairment in functioning.</p>
                    <span class="ds-pr-info">• OSDD</span>
                    <p>OSDD stands for Other Specified Dissociative Disorder. It's a category of dissociative disorders in the DSM-5, with 4 different subtypes. OSDD-1 and OSDD-2 in particular connect with being a system. </p>
                        <p>OSDD-1 is similar to DID but without all necessary symptoms for a DID diagnosis. This is often divided into OSDD-1a where the separation between alters is not enough for DID to be diagnosed (such as the alters being different versions of the same person), and OSDD-1b where there is a lack of dissociative amnesia, though the a and b subtypes are not diagnosed.</p>
                        <p>OSDD-2 is identity dissociation due to long term  intense coersive persuasion such as cult membership, captivity/torture, or brainwashing.</p>
                        <span class="ds-pr-info">• P-DID</span>
                    <p>P-DID stands for Partial Dissociative Identity Disorder. It's characterized in the ICD-11 by there being one dominant alter, and at least one non-dominant alter who either doesn't or only rarely can front or take control of their body. </p>
