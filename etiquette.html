                    <p>To start, the most important thing when interacting with systems is to treat them as people. Respect their boundaries, listen to their individual preferences, and be personable!</p>
                    <p>There are some factors you should be sure to consider when talking with systems in general, unless they specifically request different treatment.</p>
                    <span class="ds-pr-info">• Differentiate between alters</span>
                    <p>Different alters in a system can have different preferences, wants, interests, and personalities. When interacting with different alters, make sure to get to know them individually, and don't assume things you know about one alter will apply to others.</p>
                    <p>Generally, this also means not referring to the system as if they were a singlet. Though preferences vary by system, default to referring to a system how you would a group of people and refer to specific alters rather than the system as a whole unless the topic is actually about the system as a whole.</p>
                    <span class="ds-pr-info">• Don't dismiss any alters as less real or significant</span>
                    <p>Don't act like any one alter is the main or most important one. All alters in a system are real and significant, and one fronting more often or being the first you met doesn't mean you should treat the others as less important.</p>
                    <span class="ds-pr-info">• Don't make alters feel less wanted or like they should try to switch out</span>
                    <p>If a particular alter is fronting and talking with you, asking them to switch to another alters can make whoever's fronting feel unwanted. Unless they've specifically told you that they're fine with front requests, just interact with whoever is fronting. If you want to talk with a particular alter, just wait until they're already fronting.</p>
                    <span class="ds-pr-info">• Don't ask heavy or invasive questions, particularly unprompted</span>
                    <p>Being a system can be caused by trauma, but someone being open about being a system doesn't mean they want to be asked about it. Don't question if they have a trauma history, or ask them to explain what caused their system to exist. Someone's trauma is not your business if they do not offer the information themself.</p>
                    <span class="ds-pr-info">• Treat introjects as their own people, not their source</span>
                    <p>Introjects (alters who were formed based on people or characters from outside the system) are full people with their own consciousness and existence independent of their source. They are someone who happens to share traits with their source. They are not an opportunity for you to interact with a character or person they're sourced from, they are not roleplay, and they are not necessarily supportive of their source. Treat them as their own person.</p>
                    <span class="ds-pr-info">• Don't out a system</span>
                    <p>Similar to many other things such as gender, sexuality, neurodivergence, etc, systems often have to keep their plurality hidden in many circles. Being open about being a system to you is an act of trust. Do not reveal that they are a system to people who are not already aware.</p>
