                    <span class="ds-pr-info">• Systems are extremely rare</span>
                    <p>Though not exactly common, a much higher portion of the population are systems than you might expect. DID specifically is estimated to affect 1-2% of the world's population. As systems with DID are only a subset of all systems, the portion of the population who are systems is higher. That means in a group of 100 people, you'd expect there to be at least a few systems!</p>
                    <span class="ds-pr-info">• Systems all have evil alters or are likely to be violent</span>
                    <p>Systems are much more likely to be the victims of violence than the other way around. The violent alter myth has been perpetuated by many inaccurate media portrayals of systems. Systems are no more dangerous to be around than singlets are.</p>
                    <span class="ds-pr-info">• Systems with X trait are all faking and we should call them out</span>
                    <p>This is often targeted towards systems with many introjects, systems with large alter counts, systems who do or don't switch often/openly, systems who consider their alters more or less separate than "typical"</p>
                    <p>Broadly, people faking dissociative disorders is a much smaller scale issue than real systems getting harassed, forced into the closet, or being pushed into denying their own system due to fakeclaiming. Systems with any of these traits can definitely be real systems, and fakeclaiming systems does much more harm than good.</p>
                     <span class="ds-pr-info">• Dissociative disorders are like schizophrenia or delusional disorders, and alters are hallucinations or delusions</span>
                    <p>Though the experience of people who experience hallucinations and delusions are important to respect and consider, dissociative disorders are a very different set of experiences. Alters are real and have their own thoughts and feelings, and are not delusions or hallucinations.</p>
