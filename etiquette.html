                    <p>To start, the most important thing when interacting with systems is to treat them as people. Respect their boundaries, listen to their individual preferences, and be personable!</p>
                    <p>There are some factors you should be sure to consider when talking with systems in general, unless they specifically request different treatment.</p>
                    <span class="ds-pr-info">• Differentiate between alters</span>
                    <p>Different alters in a system can have different preferences, wants, interests, and personalities. When interacting with different alters, make sure to get to know them individually, and don't assume things you know about one alter will apply to others.</p>
                    <p>Generally, this also means not referring to the system as if they were a singlet. Though preferences vary by system, default to referring to a system how you would a group of people and refer to specific alters rather than the system as a whole unless the topic is actually about the system as a whole.</p>
                    <span class="ds-pr-info">• Don't dismiss any alters as less real or significant</span>
                    <p>Don't act like any one alter is the main or most important one. All alters in a system are real and significant, and one fronting more often or being the first you met doesn't mean you should treat the others as less important.</p>
                    <span class="ds-pr-info">• Don't ask heavy or personal questions, particularly unprompted</span>
                    <p>Being a system can be caused by trauma, but someone being open about being a system doesn't mean they want to be asked about it. Don't question if they have a trauma history, or ask them to explain what caused their system to exist.</p>
